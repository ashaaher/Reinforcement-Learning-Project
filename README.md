# BipedalWalker with TD3 actor critic

# Motivation
* The main goal of this project is that to solve the problem characterized by the environment BipedalWalker-v3. ( https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v2/ ).The problem arises as concluded when the robot chooses correct actions for don't fall and walk to the end of the path.
